For example, here it is written as f of x equals x squared minus three.\n                <break time=\"1s\"/>\n                <bookmark mark=\"graph\"/>\n<split/>\n                The next concept is that of the graph of a function.\n                <break time=\"1s\"/>\n                The graph of a function describes how the function looks.\n                To obtain a function's graph, we simply plot some points that we can calculate using the function term onto a coordinate plane.\n                And because we don't have the time to plot an infinite number of points, we typically choose just a few points\n                Then, we connect the points to obtain the graph. Sometimes, we need to draw many points to get an accurate graph, other times only a few points are enough."

Let's look at each of them.\n<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nLet's start with <bookmark mark=\"even_positive\"/> even roots of positive numbers.<split/>\nFor example, <bookmark mark=\"evenEx1a\"/>the square root of 4, or\n<bookmark mark=\"evenEx2a\"/>the fourth root of 16.<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nIn these cases, there are always <bookmark mark=\"even_pos_sol\"/>two solutions, and they are both positive.\n<break time=\"1s\"/>\nNow let's look at <bookmark mark=\"even_negative\"/> even roots of negative numbers.<split/>\nFor example, <bookmark mark=\"evenEx1b\"/>the square root of negative 4, or\n<bookmark mark=\"evenEx2b\"/>the fourth root of negative 16.<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nIn these cases, <bookmark mark=\"even_neg_sol\"/>there are no solutions. <bookmark mark=\"default3\"/>\n<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nSo quick summary, if we're taking an even root of a number x, then there are\n<bookmark mark=\"even_pos_sol2\"/>two solutions if x is positive, <split/>and\n<bookmark mark=\"even_neg_sol2\"/>no solutions if x is negative.\n<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nNow let's look at <bookmark mark=\"odd_positive\"/> odd roots of positive numbers.<split/>\nFor example, <bookmark mark=\"oddEx1a\"/>the cube root of 8, or\n<bookmark mark=\"oddEx2a\"/>the fifth root of 32.<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nIn these cases, there is always <bookmark mark=\"odd_pos_sol\"/>one solution, and it is positive.<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nFinally, <split/>let's look at <bookmark mark=\"odd_negative\"/> odd roots of negative numbers.\nFor example, <bookmark mark=\"oddEx1b\"/>the cube root of negative 8, or\n<bookmark mark=\"oddEx2b\"/>the fifth root of negative 32.<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nIn these cases, there is always <bookmark mark=\"odd_neg_sol\"/>one solution, and it is negative.\n<break time=\"0.5s\"/>\nSo, final summary, <split/>if we're taking an odd root of a number x, then\nthere is <bookmark mark=\"odd_pos_sol2\"/>one solution if x is positive,\nand <bookmark mark=\"odd_neg_sol2\"/>one solution if x is negative. <bookmark mark=\"default4\"/>\n<break time=\"1s\"/>\nSo those were the four cases.
