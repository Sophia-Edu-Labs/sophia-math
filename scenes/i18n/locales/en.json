So f of 3 equals one for the first square,\nplus two for the second square, plus four for the third square, which is seven.\nAnd so on.\nAs you can see, the amount you have to pay increases rapidly with the number of squares you have to pay for,\nbecause for each square, you have to pay twice as much as for the previous square.\nWe call this <bookmark mark=\"exponential\"/>exponential growth..."
