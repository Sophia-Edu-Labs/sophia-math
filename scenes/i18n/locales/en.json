        "voiceover": "What is the reason that in the chessboard example, the number of grains of rice you have to pay\nincreases so fast? How does rice get so much more expensive than gold, so quickly?\nThe answer to both of these questions is the same: Exponential Growth.\nLet's compare the two options, rice and gold, again. Specifically,\nlet's describe them <bookmark mark=\"cords\"/> using functions.\nWe'll start with gold.\nThe function that describes the amount of gold you have to pay for a given number of squares is\n<bookmark mark=\"f_gold\"/> f of x equals x.\nFor the first square, you have to pay one gold coin. So f of 1 equals 1.\nFor the second square, you have to pay one gold coin as well. So f of 2 equals one for the first square,\nplus one for the second square, which is two. And so on. As you can see, the amount you have to pay\nincreases linearly with the number of squares you have to pay for. One extra square costs exactly\nas much as each of the previous squares, and the last square costs exactly as much as the first one.\nWe call this <bookmark mark=\"linear\"/>linear growth...\n\nNow, let's <bookmark mark=\"clean\"/> look at rice for comparison.\nThe <bookmark mark=\"cords_rice\"/>function that describes the amount of rice you have to pay for a\ngiven number of squares is <bookmark mark=\"f_rice\"/> an exponential function\nFor the first square, you have to pay one grain of rice. So f of 1 equals 1.\nFor the second square, you have to pay two grains of rice. So f of 2 equals one for the first square,\nplus two for the second square, which is three. \nFor the third square, you have to pay four grains of rice. So f of 3 equals one for the first square,\nplus two for the second square, plus four for the third square, which is seven.\nAnd so on.\nAs you can see, the amount you have to pay increases rapidly with the number of squares you have to pay for,\nbecause for each square, you have to pay twice as much as for the previous square.\nWe call this <bookmark mark=\"exponential\"/>exponential growth..."
